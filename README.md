## Quick Start

These steps will guide you to set up your local development environment and preview the website.

### Prerequisites

- `node >= 25.2.1`
- `yarn >= 4.12.0`

I personally use [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) to prepare all my development environments and it is already configured [here](mise.toml).

However, using mise is not a requirement, feel free to use whatever you prefer •ᴗ• .

### Installing Dependencies

1. Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Telmooo/miyazono.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Launching development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

The local website can be see on [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321).
